- Explore the distinctions between traditional Database Management Systems (DBMS) and Data Warehousing, understanding their purposes and architectural differences.

2\. **Differences Between OLTP and OLAP**

- Dive into the crucial differences between Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) systems.

3\. **Three-Tier Architecture**

- Learn about the three-tier architecture commonly used in data warehousing, which separates data storage, processing, and presentation layers.

4\. **Data Modeling**

- Understand the art of data modeling in the context of data warehousing, encompassing conceptual, logical, and physical models.

5\. **Data Warehousing Models**

- Explore various data warehousing models, including the Star Schema, Snowflake Schema, and Fact Constellation Schema, to design efficient data warehouses.

6\. **OLAP Cube Operations**

- Delve into OLAP cube operations such as roll-up, drill-down, slicing and dicing, and pivoting, essential for multidimensional data analysis.

7\. **Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD)**

- Learn about the KDD process, which involves discovering valuable patterns and knowledge from large datasets through data mining and machine learning.

8\. **Outlier Analysis**

- Discover techniques for identifying and dealing with outliers in datasets, a crucial step in data analysis and data mining.

9\. **Proximity Measures for Ordinal, Binary, and Asymmetric Attributes**
